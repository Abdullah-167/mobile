    "The sign language interpreting service allows deaf people to communicate and interact in a social context. Rafiky is firmly convinced of the potential that this service represents. The goal is to extend accessibility to all in communication rather than limiting it.Sign language is the only language known and mastered by deaf people. Knowing this language means being able to communicate with them without them feeling excluded in any way in an interlinguistic and social interaction. When organizing an international event it is probable that there may be deaf people among the participants. To prevent them from feeling left out or neglected rely on professional sign language interpreting services. Sign language is a full-fledged language with its rules and grammatical syntax. Recognized today as the foundation of the culture of the categories of deaf people or people with difficulty in understanding it actually has a very ancient history. Socrates in the work 'Cratilo' describes the spontaneity in gestural and non-verbal communication that arose in circumstances in which the spoken language could not reach. Today there are more than 300 sign languages each with its own linguistic principles and rules: Italian Sign Language (LIS) American Sign Language (ASL) English Sign Language (British Sign Language BSL) etc.",

          <p>B.&nbsp;<strong>Oggetto dell&rsquo;Accordo</strong></p>
          <p>1. Con l'accettazione del presente Accordo e dei Termini ivi inclusi, il Cliente affida al Fornitore, che si riserva di accettare in modo espresso, l&rsquo;incarico di prestare un servizio come di volta in volta nello specifico individuato (d&rsquo;ora in avanti anche solo &ldquo;Ordine&rdquo;). I servizi oggetto dell&rsquo;Accordo, nella loro pi&ugrave; ampia eccezione (ricomprendendo tutti quelli compatibili con l&rsquo;oggetto sociale del Fornitore) saranno collettivamente ed individualmente riferiti quali i &ldquo;Servizi&rdquo;.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2. Per quanto di inerenza ai nostri Servizi ed all&rsquo;Oggetto dell&rsquo;Accordo di volta in volta stipulato ci sforziamo di fornire informazioni accurate sulle specifiche e sui prezzi. Nonostante ci&ograve;, possono verificarsi errori tipografici, informatici e di battitura. Per questo motivo il Fornitore si riserva il diritto di correggere eventuali errori, inesattezze o omissioni, nonch&eacute; di modificare o aggiornare le informazioni (comprese, senza limitazione, le informazioni relative a testo, prezzi, disponibilit&agrave; e descrizioni dei prodotti) in qualsiasi momento senza preavviso (anteriormente ad aver confermato un ordine).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3. L&rsquo;Utente non potr&agrave; in alcun modo cedere a terzi il presente Contratto.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>C.&nbsp;<strong>Servizi ed Ordini</strong></p>
          <p>1. Le funzionalit&agrave; di acquisto del Sito Web sono disponibili per gli utenti di et&agrave; pari o superiore ai 18 anni. Utilizzando questo Sito Web, l'utente dichiara e garantisce di avere piena capacit&agrave; di agire per stipulare un contratto vincolante. Il Fornitore, in caso di acquisto effettuato da soggetto privo delle summenzionate qualit&agrave;, si riserva il diritto di annullare l&rsquo;acquisto trattenendo le somme.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2. Ogni richiesta di Servizi deve essere accompagnata da un ordine composto dal prezzo sul quale le parti si sono accordate. L&rsquo;accettazione dell&rsquo;Ordine avviene nel momento in cui il Cliente accetta il Preventivo ed il Fornitore presta la sua disponibilit&agrave; ad effettuare l&rsquo;incarico.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3. Il Cliente &egrave; l&rsquo;unico responsabile di controllare e verificare che l&rsquo;Ordine sia completo e corretto. In particolare, &egrave; indispensabile che l&rsquo;utente si assicuri che tutti i Servizi che intende acquistare siano correttamente inseriti nell&rsquo;Ordine con le dovute specifiche. Nel momento in cui il Cliente dovesse richiedere delle modifiche all&rsquo;Ordine, dovr&agrave; comunicarle per iscritto o tramite e-mail per permetterci di inviare un Preventivo rettificato. Nel caso di accettazione, l&rsquo;Ordine rettificato ed eventuali variazioni di prezzo diventeranno parte integrante dell&rsquo;Ordine. Di conseguenza, anche la data di consegna dei nostri Servizi potrebbe subire emendamenti, se non diversamente concordato.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>4. Il Fornitore si riserva il diritto di rifiutare eventuali commissioni a sua insindacabile discrezionalit&agrave;. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>5. Se un Servizio o un Ordine &egrave; elencato a un prezzo errato, con informazioni errate o con una prezzistica errata, il Fornitore ha il diritto, a sua esclusiva discrezione e nella misura massima consentita dalla legge, di rifiutare o annullare la transazione incriminata.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Laddove il metodo di pagamento dell'utente sia stato addebitato per qualsiasi ordine successivamente annullato, il Fornitore emetter&agrave; un rimborso a credito della stessa entit&agrave; sul metodo di pagamento utilizzato.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In caso di annullamento di un ordine da parte del Cliente, viceversa, il lavoro gi&agrave; effettuato sar&agrave; fatturato integralmente riservandosi il Fornitore di decidere, a sua insindacabile discrezionalit&agrave;, in che misura addebitare il lavoro ancora sospeso e non effettuato.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>6. I prezzi e la disponibilit&agrave; dei nostri Servizi sono soggetti a modifiche senza preavviso.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>7. Offerte di particolari beni e servizi potranno essere assoggettate a termini e condizioni contrattuali specifici pubblicati sul Sito Web. In tal caso gli specifici termini e condizioni per i singoli beni e servizi offerti prevarranno sulle Condizioni ivi incluse, ove in contrasto con quest&rsquo;ultime.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>D.&nbsp;<strong>Politiche di Esecuzione dei Servizi</strong></p>
          <p>1. I testi tecnici saranno accompagnati da documenti di riferimento forniti dal Cliente e/o di disegni o piantine che permettano una migliore comprensione degli stessi. Ci impegneremo affinch&eacute; i nostri Servizi riflettano il pi&ugrave; fedelmente possibile il contenuto originale, tenendo conto di possibili errori tipografici o evidenti, nonch&eacute; di variazioni linguistiche (incluse, ma non limitatamente a, variazioni nel conteggio parole). Generalmente le traduzioni non saranno soggette ad adattamenti, riscritture o variazioni, se non diversamente concordato dalle parti.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2. L'unit&agrave; di conteggio per una traduzione &egrave; la parola nella lingua di origine, salvo accordi particolari specificati per iscritto. Come gi&agrave; specificato, non saremo tenuti a controllare e/o verificare l&rsquo;autenticit&agrave; del Contenuto caricato dal Cliente e non saremo responsabili dello stesso sotto alcun profilo di responsabilit&agrave; giuridica. Il Cliente accetta e conviene che &egrave; l&rsquo;unico responsabile a garantire la validit&agrave;, la leggibilit&agrave; e l&rsquo;utilizzabilit&agrave; del contenuto fornito. Non garantiamo e non rispondiamo per qualsiasi contenuto impreciso o illeggibile e non saremo ritenuti responsabili per eventuali errori od omissioni riconducibili a errori od omissioni del Cliente.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3. Nel caso in cui i Servizi includano la traduzione o l&rsquo;interpretazione (orale, scritta o di altro tipo) tra due lingue differenti, il Cliente conviene ed accetta che:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(i) tale traduzione o interpretazione avverr&agrave; nella lingua principale utilizzata da quel Paese o comunit&agrave; in questione (come specificato nell&rsquo;Ordine), se non diversamente concordato dalle parti. Non garantiamo la fornitura di Servizi in un particolare dialetto o sulla base di specifiche regole sintattiche e/o lessicali proprie di una regione, se non da Noi precedentemente approvato per iscritto e specificato nell&rsquo;Ordine;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(ii) ci potrebbero essere variazioni o differenze nel conteggio parole (il numero potrebbe risultare maggiore o minore) tra l&rsquo;originale e il prodotto finito;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(iii) nel caso in cui si tratti di traduzione o interpretazione da o verso una lingua rara o un dialetto raro (da noi riconosciuto come tale ed a lei espressamente indicato), non garantiamo e non saremo responsabili per eventuali errori od omissioni.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>4. Per poterle fornire correttamente i Servizi, potrebbe essere necessario ricevere ulteriori informazioni e chiarimenti. Nel caso in cui tali informazioni non ci vengano fornite entro un tempo ragionevole o ci vengano fornite informazioni errate o incomplete, potremmo decidere di recedere dal Contratto o di rettificare la data di consegna dei nostri Servizi indicata nell&rsquo;Ordine, posticipandola di un tempo che riterremo idoneo a colmare il ritardo.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>E.&nbsp;<strong>Politiche di Consegna, Rimborso e Cancellazione</strong></p>
          <p>1. La data di consegna dei Servizi &egrave; quella risultante dall&rsquo;Ordine. Le modalit&agrave; di consegna dell&rsquo;Ordine saranno quelle comunicate di volta in volta e ritenute pi&ugrave; appropriate a nostra piena ed insindacabile discrezione. Di regola, a meno che non sia specificato espressamente per iscritto, le consegne degli Ordini avvengono in via digitale. Eventuali costi per l&rsquo;esecuzione e la consegna di un Ordine in via analogica (ad esempio tramite servizio postale o corriere espresso) saranno totalmente a carico del Cliente. Non saremo responsabili per qualsiasi inadempimento, ritardo, errore o omissione imputabili al servizio postale o al corriere durante la consegna dei Servizi indicati nell&rsquo;Ordine.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2. Tutte le transazioni devono considerarsi quali definitive e quindi non idonee per il successivo ritorno, rimborso o credito. Nuovamente, prima di acquistare un Servizio, invitiamo caldamente gli Utenti a verificare con attenzione l&rsquo;Ordine, come specificato in precedenza, il Fornitore, alla luce di cancellazione dell&rsquo;Utente, pu&ograve; applicare penali. Unica eccezione &egrave; da rinvenirsi laddove le leggi applicabili nella vostra giurisdizione prevedano diversamente. In ogni caso il recesso dal Contratto per il Cliente &egrave; sempre possibile, fermo restando l&rsquo;applicazione di penali come indicato (ad eccezione di particolari normative applicabili all&rsquo;Utente anche in virt&ugrave; del suo status di consumatore). Seguendo la normativa di riferimento &egrave; comunque escluso il rimborso per Servizi utilizzati anche parzialmente.</p>
          <p>Tutte le cancellazioni devono essere effettuate per iscritto e inoltrate via e-mail. La data di ricezione dell&rsquo;e-mail far&agrave; fede per considerare valida la cancellazione.</p>
          <p>Si specifica che, anche in caso di rimborso, verranno addebitati integralmente tutti i costi non rimborsabili come spese bancarie, costi bancari sostenuti, spese vive e tasse per il rimborso.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3. Non &egrave; previsto alcun diritto al rimborso per:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(i) mancato utilizzo totale o parziale;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(ii) dati forniti / dichiarazioni parzialmente o integralmente inesatti o mendaci.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>4. Ci riserviamo il diritto di sospendere o posticipare la data di consegna/fornitura del Servizio o di rescindere il Contratto qualora si verifichi un evento come di seguito specificato:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(i) evento di forza maggiore;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(ii) vi sia la necessit&agrave; di risolvere alcuni problemi tecnici o di apportare modifiche tecniche minori;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(iii) vi sia la necessit&agrave; di aggiornare i nostri Servizi affinch&eacute; si adeguino alle leggi pertinenti e ai requisiti normativi;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(iv) siano state richieste aggiunte e modifiche all&rsquo;Ordine;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(v) vi sia la mancata osservanza da parte dell&rsquo;Utente di ciascuna norma applicabile (ricomprendendo la creazione di materiale discriminatorio, istigatorio di comportamenti violenti, fraudolento o qualsiasi comportamento comunque illecito);&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(vi) vi sia il mancato, inesatto e/o ritardato pagamento del corrispettivo previsto;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(vii) altre situazioni ad esclusiva discrezionalit&agrave; del Fornitore;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Occasionalmente, potrebbe essere necessario apportare delle modifiche ai Servizi, ad esempio, al fine di adeguarli a cambiamenti delle leggi e dei requisiti normativi pertinenti, o per integrare modifiche tecniche minori come, ma non limitatamente a, questioni linguistiche regionali, tipografiche o di dialetto.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>F.&nbsp;<strong>Politiche di Pagamento</strong></p>
          <p>1. Il prezzo del servizio, sia esso singolo o congiuntamente ad altri, &egrave; determinato nell&rsquo;Ordine, fermo restando quanto stabilito su eventuali aggiornamenti dello stesso.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2. Tutti i servizi sono fatturati in EUR. Si informa che, nel caso in cui la valuta locale dell'Utente sia diversa dall'EUR, verr&agrave; automaticamente convertita nella valuta sopra indicata. I prezzi includono l'IVA esclusivamente laddove ci&ograve; &egrave; specificato.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3. Al fine di agevolare le transazioni commerciali, il Fornitore offre diversi metodi di pagamento. Il Fornitore si riserva il diritto, a sua esclusiva discrezione, di accettare solo alcuni dei servizi offerti.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>4. Qualora non diversamente indicato il pagamento &egrave; sempre da intendersi anticipato a mezzo bonifico bancario. Non sono ordinariamente accettati in pagamento assegni bancari, cambiali ed altre forme di promesse di pagamento. Al momento dell'acquisto, l'utente pu&ograve; avere la possibilit&agrave; di pagare tramite un Servizio Esterno di collezione del pagamento (quale, ad esempio, Paypal). Alcuni Servizi Esterni potrebbero addebitarti un'imposta sulle vendite, a seconda di dove vivi, che potrebbe cambiare di volta in volta e sulla quale il Fornitore non ha alcun potere decisionale.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>5. Prima di poter inviare un pagamento, nel caso in cui sia stato scelto il pagamento tramite carta di credito/debito, potrebbe esserti richiesto di fornire un numero di carta di pagamento valido e le informazioni associate, includendo a tal fine:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>(v) l'indirizzo di fatturazione o codice postale associato. L'Utente si impegna a fornire informazioni aggiornate, complete e accurate in merito ai metodi di pagamento utilizzati. Laddove il pagamento venga effettuato con carta di credito o debito, ci riserviamo la facolt&agrave; di:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- eseguire uno o pi&ugrave; controlli di autorizzazione;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- eventualmente tentare un nuovo addebito laddove il primo sia stato infruttuoso.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>G.&nbsp;<strong>Responsabilit&agrave; ed Obblighi</strong></p>
          <p>1. La Societ&agrave; presta i propri servizi di intermediazione secondo la migliore diligenza professionale, impegnandosi a individuare esperti traduttori ed interpreti di comprovata affidabilit&agrave;; tuttavia, non risponder&agrave; direttamente dell&rsquo;operato di questi, fatti salvi i casi di dolo e colpa grave.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2. L&rsquo;utente, in ossequio agli obblighi di correttezza e buona fede di cui agli articoli 1175 e 1275 del codice civile, informa il Fornitore, direttamente e tempestivamente, di eventuali difetti di conformit&agrave; durante l'esecuzione del servizio. Solo a fronte della tempestiva contestazione (entro 5 gg lavorativi), il Fornitore pu&ograve; porre rimedio al difetto rilevato. In caso di mancata tempestiva contestazione nulla potr&agrave; essere richiesto a titolo risarcitorio. Il Fornitore non potr&agrave; altres&igrave; essere ritenuto responsabile per difetti imputabili all&rsquo;utente o ad un terzo estraneo alla fornitura dei servizi.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3. L&rsquo;Utente si obbliga altres&igrave; a fornire del materiale in formati di buona qualit&agrave; e leggibilit&agrave;, prendendo atto che la Societ&agrave; ed i suoi traduttori/interpreti non effettueranno sul materiale originale correzioni grammaticali o formali, n&eacute; la Societ&agrave; sar&agrave; in alcun modo responsabile per traduzioni che risultino stilisticamente insoddisfacenti.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>4. In nessun caso il Fornitore potr&agrave; essere resa responsabile per traduzioni che risultino stilisticamente non soddisfacenti. Particolarmente in materia pubblicitaria, i Servizi di si limitano, se non espressamente specificato, alla semplice traduzione. Il Fornitore non &egrave; tenuto a redigere il testo in uno stile pubblicitario diverso da quello del testo sorgente. La nostra responsabilit&agrave;, ad ogni modo, si limita all'importo corrisposto.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>H.&nbsp;<strong>Violazioni ed Indennizzi</strong></p>
          <p>1. L'utente si impegna a risarcire e tenere indenne il Fornitore per eventuali danni derivanti da una violazione dei presenti Termini, o di altri accordi.</p>
          <p>L'utente riconosce ed accetta che, in caso di violazione o minaccia di violazione di qualsiasi disposizione relativa ai presenti Termini, o qualsiasi altro accordo, il danno subito dal Fornitore non sar&agrave; compensabile con i soli danni monetari e, di conseguenza, il Fornitore avr&agrave; diritto al ristoro di anche tutti i danni non patrimoniali subiti.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2. In caso di mancato rispetto da parte nostra delle presenti Condizioni, il rimborso o altro, sar&agrave; limitato al prezzo specificato nell&rsquo;Ordine. Non rispondiamo di perdite o danni imprevedibili. La perdita o il danno &egrave; da intendersi prevedibile nel caso in cui il suo verificarsi sia ovvio o se, al momento della stipula del Contratto, entrambe le parti erano a conoscenza del fatto che tale perdita o danno si sarebbe potuta verificare.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I.&nbsp;<strong>Limitazione di Responsabilit&agrave;</strong></p>
          <p>1. Il Fornitore risponde unicamente dei danni arrecati all&rsquo;utente a motivo dell&rsquo;inadempimento totale o parziale delle prestazioni contrattualmente dovute, a meno che provi che l&rsquo;evento &egrave; derivato da fatto dell&rsquo;Utente (ivi comprese iniziative autonomamente assunte da quest&rsquo;ultimo nel corso dell&rsquo;esecuzione dei servizi) o dal fatto di un terzo a carattere imprevedibile o inevitabile, da circostanze estranee alla fornitura delle prestazioni previste in contratto, da caso fortuito, da forza maggiore, ovvero da circostanze che lo stesso Provider non poteva, secondo la diligenza professionale, ragionevolmente prevedere o risolvere.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2. Non siamo inoltre responsabili per:</p>
          <p>(i) eventuali perdite commerciali. Nel caso in cui il Cliente si avvalga dei nostri Servizi a fini commerciali, aziendali o di rivendita, non saremo responsabili per eventuali perdite o danni, perdite di gestione, interruzioni di attivit&agrave; o opportunit&agrave; commerciali;</p>
          <p>(ii) danni causati da guasti, interruzioni, sovraccarichi delle linee elettriche, telefoniche, o altri sistemi di comunicazione in generale, nazionali e internazionali che impediscano la regolare fruizione dei Servizi;</p>
          <p>(iii) inadempimenti alle proprie obbligazioni scaturenti da cause di forza maggiore, quali, a titolo meramente indicativo, incendi, alluvioni, esplosioni, ecc., n&eacute; potr&agrave; essere responsabile per inadempimenti, ritardi e dinieghi in genere di terzi e/o della pubblica autorit&agrave; che pregiudicano la resa dei Servizi o ne ritardano il completamento, con particolare, ma non esclusivo riferimento al rilascio di atti di autentica ed apostille.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3. Nessun risarcimento danni potr&agrave; essere richiesto all&rsquo;Utente per danni diretti e/o indiretti &ndash; ivi incluso il mancato guadagno e la violazione di diritti d&rsquo;uso e d&rsquo;autore altrui &ndash; causati dalla errata o incompleta prestazione dei Servizi. &Egrave; in ogni caso escluso ogni risarcimento qualora la Societ&agrave; si sia offerta di porre rimedio al vizio rilevato in un termine congruo avuto riguardo degli usi del settore dei servizi di traduzione e interpretariato. In ogni caso la modifica, purch&eacute; non essenziale e/o peggiorativa, non comporta il diritto di recesso e/o di revisione del prezzo. Per ogni dubbio e chiarimento, il cliente &egrave; invitato a contattare la nostra assistenza all&rsquo;indirizzo info@lingoyou.com</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>4. La natura dei servizi offerti dalla Societ&agrave; comprende la diffusione di informazioni tra diverse parti attraverso la traduzione. Pertanto, a causa dell&rsquo;eccessiva responsabilit&agrave; che altrimenti graverebbe sulla Societ&agrave;, indipendentemente da qualsiasi altra disposizione in questi termini e condizioni o in qualsiasi altro accordo tra le parti, la Societ&agrave; non sar&agrave; responsabile nei confronti dell&rsquo;Utente e/o del cliente o di terze parti per eventuali danni (diretti e indiretti), perdite o spese derivanti da o in connessione con qualsiasi violazione di riservatezza e non divulgazione, salvo nei casi di dolo o colpa grave da parte della Societ&agrave;.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>5. Si ribadisce che, ferme le limitazioni di cui sopra, la nostra responsabilit&agrave;, ad ogni modo, si limita all'importo corrisposto.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>NEUTRAL VENUE</p>
          <p>6. L'attivit&agrave; svolta dalla Societ&agrave; nell'ambito dei Servizi offerti sul Sito Web consiste esclusivamente nell'offrire agli Utenti il Servizio prescelto mediante professionisti terzi. In nessun caso il Provider, i suoi affiliati, fornitori di servizi, dipendenti, agenti, funzionari o amministratori saranno responsabili per danni di qualsiasi tipo, derivanti da o in connessione con, l'utilizzo, o l'incapacit&agrave; di utilizzare, il Sito Web o derivante da qualsiasi azione o omissione di tali professionisti terzi. Il Provider potr&agrave; ritenersi responsabili, ai sensi dell&rsquo;ordinamento, esclusivamente per dolo o per colpa grave. Il Provider non offre alcuna garanzia specifica circa i risultati che sono attesi, sperati od ottenuti con l&rsquo;uso dei Servizi, n&eacute; circa l&rsquo;esattezza, puntualit&agrave; o aggiornamento delle informazioni ivi reperibili, fatti salvi gli obblighi contrattuali espressamente assunti.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>7. La Societ&agrave; non ha funzioni di controllo, n&eacute; &egrave; attiva nella stessa area di competenza dei terzi incaricati delle traduzioni, declinando ogni responsabilit&agrave; derivante da o connessa. Dunque, al fine di fugare ogni dubbio, il Cliente accetta e riconosce che:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(i) il nostro &egrave; essenzialmente un servizio di intermediazione e che pertanto rispondiamo unicamente, fatte salve le suddette limitazioni di responsabilit&agrave;, di tale attivit&agrave; e non dei contenuti tradotti e/o del materiale in genere prodotto tra i soggetti intermediati;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(ii) fermo quanto al punto che precede, i servizi di intermediazione e la traduzione devono ritenersi esclusivamente prestazioni di opera intellettuale, nelle quali pu&ograve; essere garantito solamente la messa a disposizione di mezzi adeguati, ma non uno specifico risultato, restando pertanto definitivamente esclusa ogni nostra responsabilit&agrave; per difetti qualitativi di qualsiasi genere contestati al servizio di traduzione in quanto tale.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>8. Le limitazioni ivi esposte ricomprendono eventuali danni diretti, indiretti, speciali, incidentali, consequenziali, etc., inclusi, a titolo esemplificativo, ma non limitativo, lesioni personali, danno biologico, disagio emotivo, perdita di entrate o profitti, perdita di dati, danni patrimoniali, danni d&rsquo;immagine, perdita di chance, etc.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>9. Quanto precede non pregiudica alcuna responsabilit&agrave; che non possa essere esclusa o limitata sulla base della legge applicabile. Resta, in ogni caso, nuovamente inteso che eventuali responsabilit&agrave; accertate a carico della Societ&agrave; non potranno eccedere quanto gi&agrave; versato economicamente dell&rsquo;Ordine.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>J.&nbsp;<strong>Informativa dei rischi</strong></p>
          <p>1. L'Utente &egrave; l'unico responsabile della sua scelta cosciente dell'uso e/o acquisto di uno qualsiasi dei servizi e prodotti offerti sul Sito Web.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>3. Il Fornitore non sar&agrave; altres&igrave; responsabile per ritardi, errori, interruzioni o inadempienze, ai sensi delle presenti Condizioni Generali, qualora il ritardo o il guasto siano direttamente o indirettamente dovuti a cause indipendenti da qualsiasi controllo, inclusi, a titolo esemplificativo e non esaustivo:</p>
